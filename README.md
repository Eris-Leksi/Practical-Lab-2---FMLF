# Eris Leksi - 9067882

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`script.ipynb`) that performs data analysis and 4 model trainings using Python. It may include tasks such as data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation. The notebook is designed for experimentation, reproducibility, and presentation of data science workflows. The dataset taken in account is the Diabetes Dataset, which is a predefined aand clean dataset from the Sklearn library.

##  Files:

- `script.ipynb` — The main notebook for running and viewing the analysis.
- `.gitignore` — Ensures unnecessary files (e.g., environment files, cache) are not tracked by Git.
- `README.md` — Documentation and instructions for using the project.
- `requirements.txt` - The requirements needed to create the virtual environment in order to run the code. Made with the pip freeze command

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.12 is installed along with the following recommended tools:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)
- Optionally, create a virtual environment with the requirements.txt file (not necessarily needed because the code is using the base Python libraries)
  But, I kindly suggest using it since there may be some different configurations on different PCs.
