This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`script.ipynb`) that performs data analysis and 4 model trainings using Python. It may include tasks such as data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation. The notebook is designed for experimentation, reproducibility, and presentation of data science workflows.

##  Files:

- `script.ipynb` — The main notebook for running and viewing the analysis.
- `.gitignore` — Ensures unnecessary files (e.g., environment files, cache) are not tracked by Git.
- `README.md` — Documentation and instructions for using the project.
